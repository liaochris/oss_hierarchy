\section{Introduction} \label{sec:intro}

\todo[inline]{To do's for the introduction\\
1) Rephrase organizational structure as the “communication and effective coordination”\\
2) Rewrite motivation to emphasize organizational resilience as the thing we don't know\\
3) Rewrite challenges to generalize it to a study of organizations (need data + for OSS can extend what we already have)\\
4) Rewrite “this paper” to focus on how I'm using OSS as a setting to study orgs\\
5) Rewrite methods to provide more intuition about how OSS maps to organizations\\
6) Rewrite findings to generalize more to organizations\\
7) Write literature – understand what the literature has done}

\textbf{Paragraphs 1-2: Motivation. After reading these paragraphs a reader in any field of economics should believe that if you answer your research question your paper will make an important contribution.}

A key issue organizations encounter is departures. An organization's capacity to solve problems depends on its members' knowledge. When a key member with  knowledge leaves, unless that key member's knowledge has been shared with the other members, the organization may lose its ability to solve certain problems. I term this knowledge loss. 

One potential way organizations can mitigate knowledge loss arising from departures is through pre-departure collaboration and communication between its members. Collaboration and communication garners organization members increased exposure to the departed member and potentially more knowledge about how they solve problems. At the same time, collaboration and communication can be time consuming activities that slow down the project's operations. Given  their potential to mitigate the downsides of knowledge loss, there's value to whether and how collaboration and communication affects projects after a key departure. Moreover, given the tradeoffs associated with collaboration and communication, there's also value in understanding the effect of collaboration and communication on organizations prior to departures. 

% I've kinda ditched the hierarchy motivation in this version of the intro. Just something to keep in midn
\textbf{Paragraphs 3-4: Challenges. These paragraphs explain why your research question has not already been answered, i.e., what are the central challenges a researcher must tackle to answer this question.}

\textbf{Data}\\
\begin{itemize}
    \item One major challenge is that data on organizations is hard to obtain because proprietary 
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Even when we do have data on organizations, we often rely on traits derived from partial view as opposed to full view of an organization.
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Studying OSS alleviates this problem
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item briefly introduce OSS - key part of other software components, produced by unaffiliated developers. OSS can be used, modified, and distributed freely by anyone, provided proper attribution is maintained (\cite{linux_foundation_what_2017}). Prominent examples of OSS projects include the programming language Python, the operating system Linux, and the machine learning framework PyTorch. 
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Much OSS activity is public and can be observed, allows us to gain insight into organizations. 
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Particularly we can observe almost full suite of actions so we can derive organizational characteristics from this full set of interactions
    \end{enumerate}
    \item OSS is also economically interesting and valuable on its own - public good created through crowdsourcing
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item according to estimates by \cite{hoffmann_value_2024}, firms would face software costs roughly 3.5 times higher if OSS did not exist. 
        \item     OSS is open and volunteers so departures are especially prevalent - many contributors do not receive financial compensation for their contributions (\cite{robles_evolution_2005}; \cite{xu_volunteers_2010}), leading to high OSS contributor turnover (\cite{izquierdo-cortazar_using_2009}; \cite{rashid_systematic_2019}). Prior research indicates that contributor turnover is important and affects key organizational goals such as  software quality (\cite{mockus_organizational_2010}; \cite{foucault_impact_2015}). 
    \end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Departure endogeneity}
Contributor departure is an endogeneous choice that may be affected by organizational structure, so there are endogeneity concerns (who leaves given organizational structure, does that have an effect etc). in OSS, Existing work documents a variety of factors that can contribute to departure such as personal dissatisfaction (\cite{hannon_retaining_2008}, \cite{yu_empirical_2012}) or job or role changes (\cite{miller_why_2019}). 

\textbf{Organizational structure endogeneity}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item If collaboration is a function of problem characteristics, then variation in the problem environment might explain variation in collaboration. I would then be confounding variation in the problem environment with all sorts of "collaboration-related" effects
    \item Individuals who benefit more from collaboration may collaborate more. This would imply that my estimates are an upper bound on the benefit from collaboration 
\end{enumerate}
% Is there something I can add about how even at companies that develop OSS there's high turnover


\iffalse
Paragraph 4 (if I end up having time to write a model): 
Model of hierarchy incorporates cooperation and communication as key features of the hierarchy that affect downstream project outcomes. However, we take these for granted and irl, communication and cooperation can't be taken for granted
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Extent of communication 
    \item Degree of cooperation, overlap (clustering)
\end{enumerate}

Existing theory tells us how organizations adapt their organizational structure and strategy in response to external shocks. However, it doesn't tell us how that adaption depends on existing organizational structure. One example: communication is an integral part of how an organization solves problems, but we don't model how it occurs. Moreover, communication itself also has pros and cons - does it have a positive effect by sharing knowledge or negative effect by creating reliance and thus inhibiting learning?

% See https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0268401217310095 for a survey of current work
- Doesn't try to separate relationship between structure and departures
- Does not consider the complementarity of organizational structure 
- Research on impact of organizational structures only provides suggestive evidence on the mechanism by which organizational structures have impacts. 
- The focus of research has been on codebase related outcomes or "project survival" as opposed to more relevant outcomes such as usage. 
\fi 

\textbf{Paragraph 5: This Paper. This paragraph states in a nutshell what the paper accomplishes and how. }

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Leverage github microdata to identify and examine the effect of plausibly exogeneous departures in OSS projecys. I then examine how pre-departure organizational characteristics influence two types of post-departure outcomes: GitHub project activity (think team performance) and downstream software development (think business outcomes) to understand impact of org structure. Using contributor-level microdata, I probe further at the underlying mechanisms that drive this

\end{enumerate}


\longterm[inline]{Paragraphs 6-7: Model. Summarize the key formal assumptions you will maintain in your analysis.

Per discussion with Jesse, I can include a model if it makes mechanisms easier to explain. }
% formal model
% lol don't have a model. 

\textbf{Paragraphs 8-9: Data. Explain where you obtain your data and how you measure the concepts that
are central to your study}
\todo[inline]{Edit this}
I study a subset of open-source software projects: Python libraries. These libraries are essential to development in Python, one of the world’s most widely used programming languages. Almost all are open source and distributed primarily through the Python Package Index (PyPi). I obtained download and release data from PyPi and restrict the sample to widely used libraries — those with over 1,000 monthly downloads each month from July 2018 to September 2023. Contributor-level data was acquired from the GitHub Archive, and project-level software quality was measured using the Open Source Software Foundation (OSSF) Scorecard. 

My primary analysis focuses on the impact of major contributor departures—defined as contributors who are highly involved over an extended period and permanently exit the project. 

\todo[inline]{Currently using network to identify key contributors, test using either network or commits for departed. Org structure characterized using activity - communication and collaboration}
To quantify organizational structure, I construct contributor interaction networks for each project using data on contributor participation in GitHub discussions and code reviews. These networks reveal the hierarchical structures that commonly emerge in OSS development (\cite{crowston_coordination_2005}, \cite{crowston_core_2006}, \cite{crowston_hierarchy_2006}), which I use to measure communication and engagement patterns within and across different levels of the contributor hierarchy.

\textbf{Paragraphs 10-11: Methods. Explain how you take your model to the data and how you overcome the
challenges you raised in paragraphs 3-4.}
\textbf{edit}

I use the linear panel event-study design from \cite{freyaldenhoven_visualization_2021} with observations at the OSS project level and the treatment date defined as the date of a major contributor's departure. To simplify identification of dynamic effects, I restrict the sample to projects with a single major contributor departure. The control group consists of not-yet-treated projects that also experience a single departure. This ensures that treatment effect estimates are not biased by unobserved differences between projects that do and do not undergo departures.

To isolate plausibly exogenous events, I focus on abrupt departures, defined as cases where the contributor remains highly active in their final pre-departure period. Such departures tend to be driven by external shocks unrelated to the project, such as job changes or major life events, rather than internal or project-related factors such as declining interest, dissatisfaction, or project wind-down, which typically involve gradual disengagement. I assess treatment effect heterogeneity by comparing post-departure outcomes across projects grouped by pre-departure organizational characteristics.

\iffalse
\textcolor{red}{Ideally, I'd like to be able to just compare projects who experienced departures in similar timeframes but I don't know any methods that allow you to do this and still enable you to examine long-term effects without adding restrictions. Perhaps I can add this as a robustness check?. }

% does the miller paper describe "abrupt"
Quotes from Miller 2019
 One such blog post describes how “as [my project’s] pop-
ularity rose and rose, my drive to continue to create new projects, fell. All while the
burden of supporting the needs of the massive user bases of my successful projects and
the pressure of maintaining those projects grew.”1

Also, Miller 2019 use abrupt engagement and finds different results from other papers
\fi

\textbf{Paragraphs 12-13: Findings. Describe the key findings. Make sure they connect clearly to the motiva-
tion in paragraphs 1-2.}
% I also want a robustness for departures (that are vs. aren't abrupt) using that departure filtering event study graph
\begin{itemize}
    \item Collaboration matters, but only for collaborators who work together and only over a very extended period of time
    \item Other collaboration doesn't matter because very little "readjustment" happens in OSS
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Paragraphs 14-15: Literature. Lay out the two main ways your paper contributes to the literature. Each paragraph should center around one contribution and should explain precisely how your paper differs from the most closely related recent work.}
\textbf{approach wil be to write down strands of related literature and return to this once I'm done }

I think it applies to two literature
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Literature on OSS in economics: no one has thought about departures, rare to see big data deployed. Literature on OSS doesn't address endogeneous nature of departures or org structure well 
    \item Literature on org/team structure: how do org characteristics affect outcomes. In economics, there's the theory (Brynjolfsson, Milgrom - complementary org structures), applications to management (Bloom) and evidence from the inventor literature (Azoulay, Jaravel)
\end{enumerate}

    \begin{itemize} 
        \item When defining the network, also define the different types of contributors. I should also decide whether to define outcome or covariates first 
    \end{itemize}
    \item Definition of departure, choice of details 
\end{enumerate}}

\subsection{Measuring Departure}
2. How do I define departure 
- commits pct, minimum number of periods
- abrupt
- restrictions on post-period activity 
- how many projects have departures, how many departures
  - how many projects have only one departure and end up being used
- picture of the ES graph for my chosen specification?
\subsection{Measuring Organizational Structure}
3. How do I define organizational structure
- How do I define the network
- How do I define the hierarchy
- How do I define the key organizational characteristics (collab, communication)
- What do the key organizational characteristics look like




\textcolor{blue}{Aspirational To Dos
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Read this  \href{https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/jep.36.3.211}{paper} in order to understand how to motivate the paper using descriptive statistics
    \item Provide insight into what a project is like, such as
    \begin{itemize}
        \item How many people are in a project at a given point in time (can I divide it into important/unimportant people)?
        \item What are churn rates like among both hierarchies?
        \item How many problems are they solving, how much disussion is there and what solutions are proposed?
        \item What do outcomes look like for these projects?
        \item Provide estimates of data coverage at a project level 
    \end{itemize}
    \item Add reference to showing that results are not sensitive to changes in parameters/if they are, justify why mine is reasonable 
    \item Describe parameters + when describing parameters, use subset of projects (full subset described in footnotes or appendix table)
\end{enumerate}}



\section{Methods} \label{sec:method}

\textcolor{red}{To do's
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Define notation and express ES equation
    \item What normalizations etc
    \item Discuss assumptions
    \item Discuss the interpretation of the event study coefficient
    \item Discuss how I execute the HTE and how the coefficient interpretation changes with HTE
    \item Defend exogeneity for HTE
    \item Discuss how I execute different subsamples and 
    \item Describe power issues, how I examine downstream outcomes and the interpretation of downstream outcome coefficients
    \item Is there anything else I do to prove causal validation?
\end{enumerate}}

\subsection{Estimating the Effect of Contributor Departures}
- Define treatment date
- Define groups
- Write out the event study formula that I'm running

- According to \cite{freyaldenhoven_visualization_2021}, what are the assumptions that need to hold?
- Defend the abrupt departures thing
\subsection{Heterogeneous Effects}
- How do I split by pre-departure organizational structure to get heterogeneous treatment effects
- Defend causality here

\section{Results} \label{sec:result}
\textbf{Goals}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item First, show that departures affect a wide variety of outcomes
    \item I'll describe why I focus on PRs opened, and show that there's relevance for downstream outcomes. At some point, I also want to bring in the bin scatter
    \item I'll begin the heterogeneous treatment effects analysis by showing that things we might expect to happen do happen. 
    \item Then, I'll validate or provide further intuition behind these results
\end{enumerate}
