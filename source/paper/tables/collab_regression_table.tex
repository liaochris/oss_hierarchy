    \textbf{Table Notes:}  Figure~\ref{fig:close_time_regression} presents the coefficients from a regression of how much time it takes to close a pull request on the average \# of reviews on a pull request, the average amount of discussion  by members per pull request, the proportion of pull requests in a organization without reviews, the continuous value of departed member collaborativeness, the average \# of important and unimportant members in an organization and the average share of discussion done by important contributors in pull requests.
    Each observation is at the organization-time period level, time fixed effects are included and standard errors are clustered at the organization level.
