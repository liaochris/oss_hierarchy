    \textbf{Figure notes:} In each panel, I display a density plot of the labelled outcome during pre-departure periods for organizations with and without highly collaborative departed contributors. Each observation is at the organization-time period level. The statistics on the rop right for each panel are the regression coefficient and standard error for regressing the outcome on departed contributor collaborativeness (in its continuous form).
