    \textbf{Figure notes:} 
    Figure~\ref{fig:boto_social_network} depicts the social network for \texttt{boto/boto3}, the Amazon Web Services Software Development Kit for Python, during the first half of 2020. 
    Each node represents a member and is scaled by its degree, defined as the number of members they interact with.
    Each edge between nodes represents interactions between members; edge thickness is positively related to the quantity of interactions between members. 
    The three nodes representing the three \textit{single-period key members} and their corresponding edges are colored in red.
