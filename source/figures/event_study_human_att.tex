    \textbf{Figure notes:} Each row depicts the difference between the ATT of event study estimates over the 5 post-periods for organizations with above and below median adoption of the organizational characteristic, for four organizational outcomes: pull requests opened, pull requests merged, new software releases, and major and minor software releases.
    Confidence intervals are 95\% confidence intervals for the difference in ATT estimates. 
    For rows without difference points, there were not sufficient observations in either the above median or below median subset to estimate both event studies.
