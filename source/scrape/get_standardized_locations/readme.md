### Overview
I geocoded locations from GitHub and Linkedin profiles using the Google Maps Geocoding API. 

### Source
Locations were obtained the geocoder provided by Google Maps. 

### When/where obtained & original form of files
I used the `GoogleV3` application from `geopy` to access the geocoder. In order to use it, you need a Google Maps token. 

### Description
- `docs/get_standardized_locations.py` obtains the standardized locations. 
- `docs/gmaps_tou.pdf` contains the Geociding API TOU. 

### Terms of Use
> You can display Geocoding API results on a Google Map, or without a map. If you want to display Geocoding API results on a map, then these results must be displayed on a Google Map. It is prohibited to use Geocoding API data on a map that is not a Google map.
